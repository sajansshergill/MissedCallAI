## DEMO SCRIPT

### [0:00 - 0:30] INTRODUCTION

**You:** "Alright, [Name], I'm going to show you exactly how this works. I'm going to call a number right now — this is set up exactly like yours would be.

Watch what happens."

[Start screen sharing]

---

### [0:30 - 1:00] MAKE THE CALL

**You:** "I'm dialing the number now. It's 11 PM on a Saturday — your business is closed, but the AI is still answering."

[Call connects]

**AI:** "Hello! Thank you for calling. I'm an AI assistant here to help you. How can I assist you today?"

**You (to prospect):** "Did you hear that? That's the AI answering. It sounds completely natural, right? Not robotic at all."

**You (to AI):** "Hi, I need a plumber. My sink is completely blocked and water is everywhere."

**AI:** "I understand that's frustrating. Can I start with your name?"

**You (to prospect):** "See? It's asking the right questions. It's qualifying the lead, just like you would."

**You (to AI):** "Sure, it's John Smith."

**AI:** "Great, John! Is this an emergency, or can it wait a day or two?"

**You (to prospect):** "It's asking about urgency — this helps prioritize the lead."

**You (to AI):** "It's pretty urgent. I can't use my kitchen at all."

**AI:** "Got it. And what's the address where we'll be coming out?"

**You (to AI):** "123 Main Street, Anytown, State 12345."

**AI:** "Perfect! So just to confirm, John, you need plumbing service for a blocked sink at 123 Main Street, and this is urgent. Is that correct?"

**You (to prospect):** "Notice how it's confirming all the details back to me. This ensures accuracy."

**You (to AI):** "Yes, that's exactly right."

**AI:** "Excellent! I'm sending you a text message right now with a link to book your appointment. You'll be able to choose a time that works for you. Is there anything else I can help you with today?"

**You (to AI):** "No, that's perfect. Thank you!"

**AI:** "Thank you for calling. Have a great day!"

[End call]

### [1:00 - 2:00] SHOW THE RESULTS

**You:** "Okay, so that just happened. Let me show you what happened behind the scenes."

[Screen share: Show Google Sheet]

**You:** "Look at this. The lead is already in the system. Right here — name, phone, service, address, urgency. All captured automatically. No manual entry. No missed information."

[Screen share: Show SMS confirmation]

**You:** "And the customer? They just got this text message with a booking link. They can schedule right now, even though it's 11 PM on a Saturday."

[Screen share: Show owner notification SMS]

**You:** "And you? You got notified immediately. You know about this lead before you even wake up. You can call them first thing in the morning, and you're already ahead of your competitors."

---

### [2:00 - 2:30] HIGHLIGHT KEY POINTS

**You:** "So here's what just happened:

1. **The call was answered** - Even though it's after hours
2. **The lead was qualified** - AI asked all the right questions
3. **The appointment was booked** - Customer got a link to schedule
4. **You were notified** - You know about it immediately
5. **Everything was logged** - In your system, ready to go

This is happening 24/7. Every single call. Even at 3 AM on a Sunday.

No more missed opportunities. No more lost revenue. No more frustrated customers calling your competitor."

---

### [2:30 - 3:00] ADDRESS CONCERNS

**You:** "Now, I know what you're probably thinking: 'What if it messes up? What if it doesn't understand the customer?'

Here's the thing: We've tested this with hundreds of calls. 95% of customers can't tell it's AI. It's using GPT-4, the same technology behind ChatGPT. It's incredibly natural.

And if it ever gets confused, it can:
- Ask for clarification
- Transfer to you
- Take a detailed message

But even if it's not perfect, it's still better than a voicemail. A voicemail gets you zero leads. This gets you 80-90% of them.

And you can always listen to the call recordings and adjust the prompts to make it even better."

---

### [3:00 - 3:30] THE ROI

**You:** "Let's talk about the math.

If you're missing 10 calls per month, and each call is worth $500 on average, that's $5,000 in lost revenue.

MissedCallAI costs $299 a month.

If it captures just 1 of those calls, it pays for itself. But it'll capture 8-9 of them. That's $4,000 to $4,500 in new revenue.

ROI: 1,300% in the first month.

But more importantly: you never lose a customer again. You never miss an emergency call. You're always available, even when you're not."

---

### [3:30 - 4:00] CLOSE

**You:** "This isn't some future technology. It's working right now. For real businesses. Right this second.

If you're ready to stop missing calls and start capturing every opportunity, we can get you set up today. Takes about 30 minutes.

I'll walk you through everything. No commitment. Just 30 minutes of your time.

What do you say? Want to get started?"

## COMMON QUESTIONS DURING DEMO

**Q: "What if the customer wants to talk to a real person?"**
**A:** "Great question. The AI can transfer to you, or it can take a detailed message. But most customers are happy to book through the AI — it's faster and more convenient."

---

**Q: "How much does it cost?"**
**A:** "It's $299 a month. But if you're missing even 1 call per month at $500, it pays for itself. Most clients see 10-20 extra leads in the first month. That's $5,000 to $20,000 in new revenue."

---

**Q: "Can I customize it?"**
**A:** "Absolutely. You can customize the questions it asks, the tone of voice, even the business type. We'll work with you to make it perfect for your business."

---

**Q: "What if I don't like it?"**
**A:** "30-day money-back guarantee. If you're not happy, we'll refund you. No questions asked. But I'm confident you'll love it."
