# Pricing Guide - MissedCallAI

Recommended pricing strategies for selling MissedCallAI to local service businesses.

---

## PRICING PHILOSOPHY

**Key Principle:** Price based on value, not cost.

- Average missed call = $500-$2000 in lost revenue
- MissedCallAI captures 80-90% of those calls
- ROI should be obvious and immediate

---

## RECOMMENDED PRICING TIERS

### TIER 1: STARTER ($297 setup + $149/month)

**Target:** Small businesses (1-5 employees)

**Includes:**
- One phone number
- Basic AI agent (standard prompt)
- Google Sheets integration
- SMS notifications to owner
- Basic support

**ROI Pitch:**
"If you miss just 1 call per month, this pays for itself. Most clients capture 5-10 extra leads."

---

### TIER 2: PROFESSIONAL ($497 setup + $299/month)

**Target:** Growing businesses (5-20 employees)

**Includes:**
- One phone number
- Custom AI agent (tailored prompts)
- Google Sheets + CRM integration
- SMS + email notifications
- Call recordings
- Analytics dashboard
- Priority support

**ROI Pitch:**
"Capture 10-20 extra leads per month. That's $5,000-$20,000 in new revenue for $299."

---

### TIER 3: ENTERPRISE (Custom pricing)

**Target:** Large businesses (20+ employees, multiple locations)

**Includes:**
- Multiple phone numbers
- White-label option
- Custom integrations (Jobber, ServiceTitan, etc.)
- Dedicated account manager
- Custom development
- SLA guarantees

**ROI Pitch:**
"Scale your lead capture across all locations. Custom solution for your needs."

---

## ALTERNATIVE PRICING MODELS

### Per-Call Pricing

**Option A:** $2-5 per call handled
- Good for: Businesses with variable call volume
- Pro: Pay only for what you use
- Con: Harder to predict revenue

**Example:**
- 100 calls/month × $3 = $300/month
- Similar to monthly pricing, but scales with usage

---

### Per-Lead Pricing

**Option B:** $15-30 per qualified lead
- Good for: Businesses that want to pay for results
- Pro: Only pay for actual leads
- Con: Need to define "qualified"

**Example:**
- 20 qualified leads/month × $20 = $400/month
- Higher price, but guaranteed ROI

---

### Annual Pricing (Discount)

**Option C:** Pay annually, get 2 months free
- Monthly: $299/month = $3,588/year
- Annual: $2,990/year (save $598)
- Good for: Cash flow and customer retention

---

## PRICING PSYCHOLOGY TIPS

### 1. Anchor High, Then Discount

**Don't say:** "It's $149/month"

**Say:** "Normally $299/month, but for new clients this month, it's $149. That's 50% off."

---

### 2. Show the Math

**Always calculate ROI:**

"Let's say you miss 10 calls per month. At $500 per job, that's $5,000 in lost revenue.

MissedCallAI costs $299/month. If it captures just 1 of those calls, it pays for itself. But it'll capture 8-9 of them. That's $4,000-$4,500 in new revenue.

ROI: 1,300% in the first month."

---

### 3. Compare to Alternatives

**"What does a receptionist cost?"**
- Part-time receptionist: $2,000-$3,000/month
- MissedCallAI: $299/month
- "It's like having a receptionist for 10% of the cost, and they never sleep."

---

### 4. Create Urgency

**Limited-Time Offers:**
- "First 10 clients this month get 50% off setup"
- "Lock in $149/month pricing (normally $299) if you sign up this week"

---

### 5. Offer Payment Plans

**For Setup Fee:**
- Option 1: Pay $297 upfront
- Option 2: Pay $99/month for 3 months (no interest)

Makes it easier to say yes.

---

## NEGOTIATION STRATEGY

### If They Say "Too Expensive":

**Response 1:** "I totally understand. Let me ask you this: how much is one missed call worth to you?"

[Wait for answer]

"If it's $500, and you miss 10 calls per month, that's $5,000. This is $299. Even if it only captures 1 call, it pays for itself. But it'll capture 8-9. The math works."

---

**Response 2:** "What if we started with a 7-day free trial? No credit card. You test it with real calls. If it doesn't work, you cancel. No risk. If it does work, you're making money from day one."

---

**Response 3:** "I hear you. What would make this a no-brainer for you? Is it the setup fee? The monthly? Let's find a number that works."

[Then negotiate, but don't go below $99/month]
