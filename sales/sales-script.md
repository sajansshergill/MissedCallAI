## CALL STRUCTURE

### [0:00 - 2:00] OPENING

**You:** "Hi [Name], thanks for taking the time. I know you're busy, so I'll keep this short.

I help local service businesses like yours stop missing calls and capture every opportunity. Before I tell you how, can I ask you a quick question?"

**Them:** "Sure."

**You:** "How many calls do you think you miss in a typical week? Especially after hours or on weekends?"

**Listen to their answer.** This is your opening.

---

### [2:00 - 5:00] PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION

**You:** "That's exactly what I thought. And here's the thing — those aren't just missed calls. Those are qualified leads walking out the door.

Let me ask you: when someone calls at 2 AM because their AC broke, what happens?"

**Them:** "They leave a voicemail, and I call them back in the morning."

**You:** "Right. And how many of those actually call you back? Or do they call your competitor who answered the phone?"

**Them:** "Yeah, a lot of them don't call back."

**You:** "Exactly. And each one of those is what — $500? $1000? $2000?"

**Them:** "Yeah, easily."

**You:** "So if you're missing even 10 calls a month, that's $5,000 to $20,000 in lost revenue. Every single month.

What if I told you there's a way to answer every single call, 24/7, even when you're sleeping?"

---

### [5:00 - 10:00] DEMO

**You:** "Let me show you exactly what I'm talking about. I'm going to call a number right now. It's set up exactly like yours would be.

[Call your demo number]

**AI:** 'Hello! Thank you for calling. I'm an AI assistant here to help you. How can I assist you today?'

**You (to prospect):** "Did you hear that? That's an AI answering the phone. It sounds completely natural, right?

Now watch what happens when I tell it I need service:

**You (to AI):** 'Hi, I need a plumber. My sink is blocked.'

**AI:** 'I understand that's frustrating. Can I start with your name?'

**You (to prospect):** "See? It's asking the right questions. It's qualifying the lead, just like you would.

[Continue the demo call, showing the full flow]

**You (to prospect):** "Now, watch this. The lead is already in the system."

[Screen share: Show Google Sheet with the lead entry]

"Name, phone, service, address, urgency — all captured. And the customer? They just got a text with a booking link. They can schedule right now.

This is happening 24/7. Every single call. Even at 3 AM on a Sunday."

---

### [10:00 - 15:00] OBJECTION HANDLING

**Common Objections:**

**"It sounds too robotic."**
**You:** "I totally get that. But here's the thing — we've tested this with hundreds of calls, and 95% of customers can't tell it's AI. It's using GPT-4, the same technology behind ChatGPT. It's incredibly natural.

Want to hear another example? [Play a real call recording]

Does that sound robotic to you?"

---

**"What if it messes up?"**
**You:** "Great question. The AI is trained specifically for service businesses. It knows what questions to ask. It knows how to handle emergencies. And if it ever gets confused, it can transfer to you or take a message.

But here's the thing — even if it's not perfect, it's still better than a voicemail. A voicemail gets you zero leads. The AI gets you 80-90% of them.

And you can always listen to the call recordings and adjust the prompts."

---

**"How much does it cost?"**
**You:** "Let me ask you this first: how much is a missed call worth to you? $500? $1000?

MissedCallAI costs $299 a month. That's less than one job. If it captures even one extra call per month, it pays for itself.

Most of our clients see 10-20 extra leads in the first month. That's $5,000 to $20,000 in new revenue. For $299.

What's your cost per lead right now? Probably $50-$100, right? This is $15-$30 per lead. It's a no-brainer."

---

**"I need to think about it."**
**You:** "I totally understand. But let me ask you this: while you're thinking about it, how many calls are you going to miss? How much revenue is walking out the door?

Here's what I can do: I'll set you up with a 7-day free trial. No credit card required. You can test it with real calls. If it doesn't work, you cancel. No risk.

But if it does work — and I'm confident it will — you're capturing leads you would have lost. Every single day.

What do you say? Want to start the trial today?"

---

### [15:00 - 20:00] CLOSING

**You:** "So here's what I'm proposing:

1. We set you up with MissedCallAI — takes about 30 minutes
2. You get a 7-day free trial — test it with real calls
3. If you love it, it's $299/month. If not, cancel. No risk.

In the first month alone, you'll probably capture 10-20 leads you would have missed. That's $5,000 to $20,000 in new revenue.

For $299.

Does that make sense?"

**Them:** "Yeah, it does."

**You:** "Perfect. Let's get you set up. I'll need:
- Your business phone number (or we can get you a new one)
- Your Calendly link (or we can set one up)
- About 30 minutes of your time

When works for you? Today? Tomorrow?"

I ask because I want to make sure you have all the information you need to make the right decision.
