## SCRIPT

**[0:00 - 0:15] HOOK**

"Here's what happens when you miss a call at 2 AM on a Sunday.

Your customer's AC just broke. They're hot, frustrated, and they need help NOW.

They call you. No answer. They leave a voicemail.

Then they call your competitor. Your competitor answers. They get the job.

You just lost $1,500. And that customer? They're gone forever.

This happens to local service businesses every single day. But it doesn't have to happen to you."

**[0:15 - 0:45] THE PROBLEM**

"Let me show you what I'm talking about.

[Screen share: Show missed call statistics or voicemail inbox]

Most home service businesses miss 30-40% of their calls. That's not just annoying — that's thousands of dollars walking out the door every month.

After-hours calls? Forget about them. Weekend emergencies? Gone. You're sleeping, but your customers are calling.

And here's the thing: these aren't just any calls. These are people who NEED your service RIGHT NOW. They're ready to pay. They're qualified leads.

But if you don't answer, they'll find someone who will."

**[0:45 - 1:30] THE SOLUTION - LIVE DEMO**

"Now, let me show you what happens with MissedCallAI.

[Screen share: Show phone dialing your Twilio number]

I'm going to call a business right now. It's 11 PM on a Saturday. Watch what happens.

[Call connects, AI answers]

**AI:** 'Hello! Thank you for calling. I'm an AI assistant here to help you. How can I assist you today?'

**You (as caller):** 'Hi, I need a plumber. My sink is completely blocked.'

**AI:** 'I understand that's frustrating. Can I start with your name?'

**You:** 'Sure, it's John Smith.'

**AI:** 'Great, John! Is this an emergency, or can it wait a day or two?'

**You:** 'It's pretty urgent, I can't use my kitchen.'

**AI:** 'Got it. And what's the address where we'll be coming out?'

**You:** '123 Main Street, Anytown.'

**AI:** 'Perfect! So just to confirm, John, you need plumbing service for a blocked sink at 123 Main Street, and this is urgent. Is that correct?'

**You:** 'Yes, that's right.'

**AI:** 'Excellent! I'm sending you a text message right now with a link to book your appointment. You'll be able to choose a time that works for you. Is there anything else I can help you with today?'

**You:** 'No, that's perfect. Thank you!'

**AI:** 'Thank you for calling. Have a great day!'

[End call]

Did you see that? The AI answered. It asked the right questions. It qualified the lead. And it's booking the appointment RIGHT NOW."

**[1:30 - 2:00] THE RESULT**

"[Screen share: Show Google Sheet with lead entry]

Look at this. The lead is already in the system. Name, phone, service, address, urgency — all captured.

[Screen share: Show SMS confirmation]

The customer got a text with a booking link. They can schedule right now.

[Screen share: Show owner SMS notification]

And the business owner? They got notified immediately. They know about this lead before they even wake up.

This is happening 24/7. Every single call. Every single day.

No more missed opportunities. No more lost revenue. No more frustrated customers calling your competitor."

**[2:00 - 2:30] THE ROI**

"Here's the math:

If you're missing 30 calls a month, and each call is worth $500 on average, that's $15,000 in lost revenue.

MissedCallAI costs $299 a month.

That's a 50x return on investment. In the first month.

But more importantly: you never lose a customer again. You never miss an emergency call. You're always available, even when you're not."

**[2:30 - 3:00] CTA**

"This isn't some future technology. It's working right now. For real businesses. Right this second.
